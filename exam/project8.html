                <p class="portpara"> We, as a group, were told to create an interactive animation of a scene from a movie [in our case Harry Potter]. The movie should be affected by our given theme, Western. Our target group was young adults interested in magic and we created a personas collage. All the graphics wew made by us in illustrator and we documented the process with storylines and sequence diagrams.</p>

            <h2 id="whitebox2">My Responsibilities <br> <br>
                <p class="portpara">Since this was a group hand-in, we divided the tasks between us. <br> <br> I was mainly in charge of the ongoing process and idea development. Alongside that I conducted the tests and created minor graphic parts in the animation. I also oversaw and helped with the code.</p>
