                <p class="portpara"> We were told to create a video introducing Cph Municipality's Bicycle Program, as a group project. The requirements consisted of filming and clipping the video and sound effects. <br> <br> Alongside we wrote a treatment, made a storyboard and coded a webpage to embed the video on.</p>

                <p class="portpara">Since this was a group hand-in, we split the tasks between us. <br> <br> I was in charge of the storyboard and thereby influenced the idea/treatment. I also took part in the filming aspect of the final product.</p>
