                <p class="portpara"> We, as a group, were told to come up with a innovative digital concept. To promote it we made a website that contained a video with a short description of the app. <br> <br> Working with the concept we had UX in mind and tried to aim for the best user experience by conducting tests of our target group. We made a business plan for our company; MatchCollab displaying amongst others our revenue plan. </p>

                <p class="portpara"> I was the SCRUM master of the group, putting me in charge of our process displayed in charts. Alongside this I was in charge of the Business Model Canvas. I coded the promotional webpage and furthermore I assisted in the testing process, writing and editing the report, and the prototyping of the app.<br> <br> OBS! <br> The app XD is inside the final pitch.</p>
