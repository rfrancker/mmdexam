                <p class="portpara"> For this assignment, we were told to animate a story, in pairs. It was mentioned that the story must have 5 chained events animatated in js. We had to include sound and the affordance should be apparent. During the process we made a storyboard and a sequence diagram as well.<br> <br> Alongside we included an array in our code and an if-statement. </p>

                <p class="portpara">Since this was a pair hand-in, we more or less completed all tasks together. <br> <br> I therefore coded and completet the essential storyboard and sequence diagram. <br> <br> OBS! <br> The storyboard and sequence diagram is linked in the animation. </p>
